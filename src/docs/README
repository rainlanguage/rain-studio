# How to use the docs

- There is only one level of categories. Using nested folders won't work.
- Category names, and articles should start with an order number. The front end will sort categories and articles by this number.
- Every category folder needs a metadata.json file, with a "category" key for the category name
- Article filenames should be kebab cased. Everything after the order number and first hyphen will be used as the slug.
- The articles need a front matter with the article title and "published:true". Articles without published:true will be filtered out.
