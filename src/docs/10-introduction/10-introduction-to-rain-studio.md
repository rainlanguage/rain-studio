Rain Studio is a web application that provides a user-friendly environment for reading, writing, testing, and deploying Rainlang expressions. It is a powerful tool for creating smart contracts and other blockchain-based applications.

<!-- ## Setting up your Rain Studio account

Follow these steps to set up your account and start using Rain Studio:

1. Click the [sign up](/sign-up) button.
2. Connect your wallet, then sign in with your wallet.
3. Once you have successfully signed up, you will be redirected to the dashboard. -->

## Using Rain Studio

Rain Studio has several different sections that you can use to manage your expressions and contracts.

- On the [Contracts](/contracts) page, you can view all the available smart contracts that you can write expressions for.
<!-- - On the [Expressions](/expressions) page, you can see expressions that other users have written, and learn more about how to write your own expressions. -->
- The [Docs](/docs) section provides guides and a reference for how to use Rain Studio and write rainlang expressions.
- Your [Profile](/settings/profile) can be accessed by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner of the screen, and selecting "Profile" from the dropdown menu. Here, you can set an avatar and your username.

## Writing expressions

To start writing expressions, follow these steps:
To view all of your expressions, click on your avatar in the top right of the screen and select "Expressions" from the dropdown menu. This will open a page where you can see all of your expressions, both draft and deployed.
To start writing an expression, click on the "New Expression" button.
Select the contract you want to write for, the contract method you want to use, and the interpreter you want to use. This will open the IDE (Integrated Development Environment), where you can write your expression.

## The Rain Studio IDE

The IDE is where you can write and test your expressions. Your expressions will automatically save as you write them. You can also save a copy of your expression for later.
The Simulator panel on the left side of the IDE will automatically simulate your expression as you write it, and display the output.
The Docs panel on the right side of the IDE provides a reference for all of the available words in rainlang, with descriptions and examples for each one. You can use this panel as a reference while writing your expression.
The Context panel lets you mock the context that would usually be provided by the contract that the expression is being run in. For example, in a token transfer the context may include "to", "from", and "amount".
The Notes panel lets you write notes for your expression. You can use this to jot down ideas or reminders for yourself.
Now that you have set up your Rain Studio account and learned the basics of how to use it, you are ready to start writing your own expressions. With practice and experimentation, you will become more familiar with Rain Studio and be able to use it to its full potential. Happy writing!
