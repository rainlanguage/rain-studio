In this guide, we'll show you how to use Rainlang to make simple calculations using Rain Studio.

## Set up your environment

To get started, open Rain Studio in your web browser and sign in. Create new expression by [clicking here](/expression/new) and and select "No contract". This will create a new blank expression in Rain Studio. In the beginning, it is important to practice writing Rainlang without writing for a specific contract

## Name your expression

Rename your expression from "Untitled expression" to "My First Expression". In the notes section, add a note saying "My First Expression from Getting Started with Rain". This will help you identify and organize your expression later on.

Your changes will be automatically saved. All changes in an expression from names to expression writing are saved automatically.

Now you are ready to make your first calculation in the Expression section.

## Things to be aware of

- Expressions are saved automatically
- You can create expressions without a contract or within a contract
- Expressions can be edited only if you are the author
- Any expression you can see, you can duplicate
- "Save a copy" of an expression duplicates it
- For now, please use Google Chrome as there may be issues with other browsers
